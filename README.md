# 1985 Vehicle Appraisal Price Prediction
This project uses the dataset from [Ward's 1985 Automotive Yearbook](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile), provided by UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, to create a prediction model to better appraise used vehicles.

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that helps answer questions like:
* Is the dealer offering a fair value for my trade-in?
* Am I putting a fair value on my car?

These questions are answered through exploring and understanding relationships between different variables and developing a prediction model based on these findings.
